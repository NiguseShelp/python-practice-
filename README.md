# Python Practice - Accumulator Pattern

This repository provides comprehensive examples and exercises for practicing the **accumulator pattern** in Python.

## What is the Accumulator Pattern?

The accumulator pattern is a fundamental programming concept where you:
1. **Initialize** a variable (accumulator) to store results
2. **Iterate** through a data structure (list, string, etc.)
3. **Update** the accumulator on each iteration
4. **Return** the final accumulated result

```

### 2. Run Advanced Examples
```bash
python advanced_accumulator_exercises.py
```

### 3. Test Everything

## What You'll Learn

### Basic Patterns
- ‚úÖ Sum accumulator (add numbers)
- ‚úÖ Product accumulator (multiply numbers)
- ‚úÖ Count accumulator (count occurrences)
- ‚úÖ Max/Min accumulators (find extremes)
- ‚úÖ String concatenation
- ‚úÖ List building
- ‚úÖ Average calculation
- ‚úÖ Frequency counting
- ‚úÖ Running totals

### Advanced Applications
- üìä **Sales Analysis** - Calculate revenue, items sold, averages
- üéì **Student Grades** - Find best/worst students, class averages
- üìù **Text Analysis** - Count words, characters, sentences
- üì¶ **Inventory Management** - Track stock levels
- üå§Ô∏è **Weather Data** - Analyze temperature and humidity
- üî¢ **Matrix Operations** - Process 2D data
- üìà **Sequence Generation** - Create Fibonacci numbers

### Practice Exercises

The repository includes both **completed examples** and **practice exercises**:

1. **Sum of Squares** - Calculate sum of squared numbers
2. **Longest Word** - Find the longest word in a list
3. **Alternating Sum** - Add and subtract numbers alternately
4. **Group by Condition** - Split items into two groups

## Usage Examples

### Basic Sum Accumulator
```python
def basic_sum_accumulator(numbers):
    total = 0          # Initialize accumulator
    for num in numbers:
        total += num   # Update accumulator
    return total       # Return result

# Usage
result = basic_sum_accumulator([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Returns 15
```

### Sales Analysis (Real-world Example)
```python
sales_data = [
    {'product': 'Apple', 'price': 1.0, 'quantity': 10},
    {'product': 'Banana', 'price': 0.5, 'quantity': 20}
]

result = sales_analysis_accumulator(sales_data)
# Returns: {'total_revenue': 20.0, 'total_items': 30, 'avg_price': 0.75}
```

## Learning Path

1. **Start with `accumulator_practice.py`**
   - Study the basic patterns
   - Run the demonstrations
   - Try implementing the exercises

2. **Move to `advanced_accumulator_exercises.py`**
   - Explore real-world applications
   - Understand complex data processing
   - Challenge yourself with harder problems

3. **Use `test_accumulators.py`**
   - Verify your implementations
   - Understand expected outputs
   - Build confidence in your solutions

## Key Concepts Reinforced

- **Variable initialization** strategies
- **Loop iteration** patterns
- **Conditional accumulation** (when to update)
- **Multiple accumulators** in one function
- **Nested data structure** processing
- **Real-world application** development

## Tips for Success

1. **Always initialize** your accumulator variable appropriately
   - `0` for sums, `-1` or first element for max/min
   - `[]` for lists, `{}` for dictionaries

2. **Think about the update step** - what happens each iteration?

3. **Consider edge cases** - empty inputs, single items, etc.

4. **Practice with different data types** - numbers, strings, objects

5. **Start simple, then add complexity** - master basic patterns first

## Challenge Yourself

After mastering the provided examples, try creating your own accumulator functions for:
- Finding the second largest number
- Calculating standard deviation
- Building histograms from data
- Processing nested JSON structures
- Analyzing log files
